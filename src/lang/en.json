The creature that bestowed the affliction makes all decisions on the compelled creature’s behalf.",

  "DL.AfflictionsFrightened": "A frightened creature makes attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane.",
  "DL.AfflictionsGrabbed": "The effects of the affliction depend on the creature’s Size. If the grabbed creature’s Size is equal to or smaller than that of the creature grabbing it, the grabbed creature cannot move away from the creature that grabbed it until it removes the affliction. If the grabbed creature’s Size is larger than that of the creature grabbing it, whenever the grabbed creature moves, the creature grabbing it can choose to move with it (by clinging to the grabbed creature’s body) or end the grab. (See Grab for more information on how to grab, and Escape for how to escape a grab.)",

  "DL.AfflictionsPrepare": "You prepare to undertake an activity when a specified event occurs. Choose one activity you would normally use an action to perform, such as attack or retreat. Then, describe what event has to occur for you to undertake it. This is the trigger. If the triggering event occurs before the end of the round, you can use a triggered action to perform the activity. You make any attack roll or challenge roll required by the activity with 1 boon. Otherwise, nothing happens.",
  "DL.AfflictionsProne": "A prone creature lies on the ground. Other creatures can move through its space. While prone, the creature can move by crawling or can use its move to stand up.
